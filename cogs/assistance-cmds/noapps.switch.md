title: Missing Switch Homebrew Apps
help-desc: What to do when some or all apps are missing from Homebrew.

If the Homebrew Menu doesn't have some or all of your homebrew apps present, either they were never installed or they're in the wrong place.
Make sure there are Homebrew apps in `SD:/switch`.
If you have either a `switch (1)`, recurring `switch`, or `Switch` folder (NOT the `Nintendo` folder!), move the contents of them to the `switch` folder on the root.
